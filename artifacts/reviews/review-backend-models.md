APPROVED: All endpoints (GET /health, GET/POST /tasks, GET/PUT/DELETE /tasks/{id}) match the OpenAPI contract with correct status codes, request/response shapes, and error handling. Data model matches data-model.yaml — Task struct fields and JSON tags are correct, UpdateFields uses pointer semantics for partial updates, TaskStore is thread-safe via sync.RWMutex, UUID v4 generated via crypto/rand, timestamps are server-set, and status defaults to "todo" on create. Input validation covers title required/max 255, description max 4096, and status enum. No security issues found.
